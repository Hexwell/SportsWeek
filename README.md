# SportsWeek

A Django web application, built in occasion of the 2017 Sport week at [I.T.I Marconi](https://www.marconiverona.gov.it/portal/) (Verona).

## Description

Tournaments of various sports, matches and single team's score are kept and presented by the application with simple views. Users don't need to login to watch the live stats roll, unless they have to create new sports, teams or assign scores to matches. 
A ranking for each sport is generated so players can keep the competition high!
